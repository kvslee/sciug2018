					<h3>Final Product Preview</h3>
					<a href="circulation_report.html" target="_blank" >Circulation Transaction Report</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Why don't we start with previewing an outcome that you are expected to build yourself after this presentation.
						This will give us a chance to understand our goal of this presentation. 
						<br><br>
						I will show a circulation transaction report using Sierra SQL API and Plotly. The basic idea is to extract data 
						from Sierra's PostgreSql database and create a visualized report using a Plotly visualization tool. 
						<br><br>
						Let's take a look at a sample outcome.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (1)</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Sierra has Web Management Reports</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>How many of you are using WMR?</li>
						<li>What is your user exprience?</li>
						<li>Decision Center</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						My first question is why we do need a custom report program. As you know, Sierra provides 
						with a build-in report prgoram, called Web Management Reports. How many of you are using WMR? 
						What is your user exprience? Personally, I do not have many words to say about it, 
						because I have not used it much. Preparing this presentation, I revisited the report program to make 
						a quick evaluation. My first impression is that it has not been improved for a long time. 
						UI is old and not intuitive. 
						<br><br>
						I know that Innovative has a new data analytic product, Decision Center. Again, I have no word to say about Decision Center, 
						because I have no exprience of the product. But I am sure how many libraries are affordable to purchase 
						the product, particularly a library running a small or medium size of colletion.
						Would it be valuable enought for the money we invest?
						<br><br>
						I think that Sierra APIs (SQL Direct, REST) are great tools to leverage the gap. A custom report program, which
						can use the APS, might not solve all things. However, it can be sufficient to take care of our business.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (2)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Who uses what?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Compare resource usages by libraries</li>
						<li>Compare by the following criteria:
							<ul>
								<li>locations</li>
								<li>patron types</li>
								<li>item types</li>
								<li>transaction times</li>
								<li>etc...</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Particularly, for today's example, we start with questioning who uses what? Haven't you ever been 
						curious about how different libraries use Sierra resources? Chapman	University have three branches
						in Sierra, Leatherby, Law Library, Brandman. 
						Our library director, in one day, threw a question. Leatherby and Law Library equally 
						share the cost of Sierra. Because the size of collections and users, the main library Leatherby
						should use more resources than Law Library does. That was a legitimate assumption. 
						Can we prove that assumption with factual data. 
						<br><br>
						This is one example of how data analysis can be useful. However, our interests can stretch 
						beyond this. We may want to compare library resource usages not only by libraries but also 
						by locations, patron types,	item types, transaction times, etc.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (3)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Why not?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plenty of data visualization tools (Open Source)</li>
						<li>Sirera offers APIs (Direct SQL & REST API)</li>
						<li>Customize a data report as you wish</li>
					</ul>				
					<aside class="notes">One of the best way to answer the question "Why?" is to ask "Why Not?"
						There are many data visualization tools available. Many of them are open source.
						For example, D3 javasript library is very popular. You may heard of many buzz words like big data, 
						AI, machine learning, etc. Our generation trys to understand large amount of data that is being produced 
						every single second thought various online services. Although libraries do not handle extremly large data as big
						companies do, we, librarians, have also genuine interest in user behaviors and interactions. 
						<br><br>
						Thankfully, Innovative has advocated Open Library Stacks (OLS) architecture. With the merger of Polaris 
						and VTLS, OLS idea becomes more important. The main idea is to creat a hightly scalable cloud platform
						to make their different products communicate each other. For this goal, APIs are critically important,
						because APIs open data to other products, which can be Innovative's another product, or third companies',
						or your local program. In 2018, it is not an exaggeration to say that the success of a product can depend 
						on how useful APIs a vendor provide with that product? APIs give a vendor a chance to expand their ecosystem,
						with outreaching more developers and users.  
						This is why Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other online services, provide their APIs. 
						<br><br>
						We, humans, are creative beings. We want to make reports in the format that we want. Not only data content, 
						but also data presentaiton matters. I know that you all have expriences in tweaking an excel file to create 
						a good report. We can do the same with the APIs.

					B: 530, 280, 74, 50, 38 	<br>
					Bar, Pie, Scatter <br><br>
					As we saw, it is very easy to create a chart. 
					</aside>

					<h3>Plotly Offline (1)</h3>
					<ul>
						
						<li><a href="https://plot.ly/python/" target="_blank">Python Library</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#initialization-for-offline-plotting" target="_blank">Plotly Offline Setup & Syntax</a></li>
						<ol>
								<li>import plotly library and chart objects</li>

								<li>Interactive dipslay modeBar</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">As I explained, Plotly supports many languages.
						I will choose Python for Today's demo. 
						<br><br>
					Python Library pages show examples and documentation (Full Reference). 
					<br><br>
					Before creating an offfline chart, Let's learn how to setup offline plotting.

						</aside>

				<section>
					<h3>Plotly Offline (2)</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">How to embed charts in a html?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Follow the same rules</li>
						<li>Use div instead of filename for output_type</li>
						<li>Store a chart into a variable</li>
						<li>Pass the variable to a template (Jinja2 engine)
						<li>Should have a template html</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">In most cases, we may need embeded charts. With simply changing an option of
						output type to div, we can create a embedded chart.<br><br>
						Why do we need a template engine and a template file. Plotly programatically outputs a chart 
						in HTML div element. We need to pass this 'div' output into a template file, which will generate
						the final form of a html file. This is useful because you can include multiple charts in one document.
						 </aside>					
				</section>				
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly Offline (3)</h3>
					<img src="images/offline_template.png">
					<aside class="notes">The plotly app output charts (bar_chart, pie_chart) as div, which will be feeded 
						into the template engine, Jinja2. The engine chooses a specified template file and embed the charts 
						in HTML format.  
						 </aside>

					<h3>PGAdmin, Destkop SQL Client</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Version 3 or 4</li>
						<li><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Connect</span> to database</li>
						<li>Run SQL <span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="2">queries</span></li>

					<h3>Setup PGAdmin</h3>
					<img src="images/pgadmin_setup.png">
					<aside class="notes">Setting PGAdmin is straightforward. (Slide)

					<h3>Know Sierra Database</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://techdocs.iii.com/sierradna/" target="_blank">SierraDNA</a></li>
						<li>Learn the structure of Sierra database</li>
						<li>Find a table in category and search</li>
						<li>Detailed view of a table</li>
						<li>ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) view</li>
						<li>Example: Transactions > Circulation > checkout</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Once you connect to Sierra Database, you should learn database structure.
						<br><br>
						PGAdmin displays all viewable tables (349 tables under sierra_view schema).
						To understand Sierra database, you need to spend some times. You may browse through all tables in PGAdmin. 
						However, often times, some tables or fields are not obvious to understand. Then, you can go to 
						SierraDNA, which is the msot valuable resource to learn Sierra database. It includes detailed descriptions
						on tables and fields. To find a table, you can follow category or use the search box on the top right. 
						SierraDNA shows not only detailed table view but also Entity Relationship
						Diagram. ERD is useful sometimes to create a join queries because it visualizes relationships among tables.   
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Find Checkouts </h3><h5>(PGAdmin Demo)</h5>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
					-- Search for checkedout
					SELECT pv.home_library_code, pv.ptype_code, c.checkout_gmt, c.renewal_count, pv.barcode, c.item_record_id 
					FROM sierra_view.checkout AS c
					JOIN sierra_view.patron_view AS pv ON pv.id = c.patron_record_id
					WHERE NOW() - c.checkout_gmt <= interval '3 hours'
					AND pv.home_library_code = 'lhome'
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">Now let me show your a real query in PGADMIN. 
						<br><br>
						First, open PGADMIN. Once we are connected to Sierra database, 
						you will see all tables and fields. 
						<br><br>To make a quesry, we click SQL button. We see query pane and result pane. 
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly & Sierra</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Transactions by Patron Home Library</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reuse an offline script shown before.</li>
						<li>Use Sierra data, not a dummy one.</li>
						<li>Three Steps:
							<ul>
								<li>get Sierra data (connection and query)</li>
								<li>transform Sierra data to plotly data</li>
								<li>generate a Plotly chart</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">So far, we have learned how to use Plotly and how to query Sierra data.
						Now is time to put them together. We will create Plotly charts that visualize transactions 
						by Patron Home Library for the last 10 days.
						<br><br>
						We will reuse the same offline script shown before in Plotly demo, 
						because visualization logic is the same. However, this time, we will use actual Sierra 
						data, instead of our dummy data. 
						<br><br>
						To get data, we need to connect and run a query on Sierra database. I showed a demo how to do this in PGAdmin.
						Now, how do we do that in a Python program?
						We will use a PostgreSQL database adapter, called psycopg2. With the psycopg2,
						You can connect the Sierra database and run a query.  
						<br><br>
						First, let's create charts and then explain. 						
						Look at the code. (the code "sierra_chart.py) The Plotly setup is exactly the same. 
						We only changed the data part (x axis and y axis)
						with the data that we get from Sirrra and transformed.     
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>SQL Output</h3>
					<img src="images/sql_output.png">
					<aside class="notes"> You may feel a little puzzled on the transformation part. 
						Why do we need to transform Sierra data before using it for Plotly? <br>
						That is because Plotly needs X and Y axes data in specific structure.  
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly X Y Axes</h3>
					<img src="images/transform_data.png">
					<aside class="notes">I have chart_data function that takes care of this business. The function reads through 
						each row of the patron_home_library_code column and count the transaction by the patron_home_library_code. 
						Finally, the function retuns a list that is right to feed into Plotly chart.  
 
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Embed Sierra Charts</h3>
						<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we embed multiple charts in one HTML page?</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Use the same SQL output from circ_trans</li>
							<li>Run data transformations on each column</li>
							<li>Pltoly option: output_type='div'</li>
							<li>Pass the chart outputs to the template engine</li>
							<li>Prepare a template html that presents multiple charts</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Can we present multiple charts in a html document? Yes, we can. 
							We can store charts in div and pass the charts into a template using Jinja2 template engine. 
							<br><br>
							For this time, because we need multiple charts, we have to run data transformation
							on each column (patron_home_library, ptype_code, time, op_code, itype_code, item_location). 
							We will feed the transformed data of each column to Plotly. 
							Then, plotly output charts into divs.
							The chart outputs will be passed to the template engine and
							the multuple charts will be displayed as instructed in a template html file.
							<br><br>
							Now let's run sierra_chart_embed.py. (the code "sierra_chart_embed.py)
						</aside>
					</section>	
					<section>
						<h3>Plotly Offline (3)</h3>
						<img src="images/offline_template.png">
						<aside class="notes">The plotly app output multiple charts as div, which will be passed 
							to the template engine, Jinja2. The engine uses a template file and embed the charts 
							as specified in the template HTML.  
							</aside>					
					</section>											
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Interactive Program</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we input specific options?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Python <span style="color:#ff9999">sys.argv</span> - read user inputs from terminal</li>
						<li>User Inputs:
							<ul>
								<li>days</li>
								<li>transaction types(o i f r) </li>
								<li>ouput filename</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>python sierra_chart_embed.py 60 oi sierra_interactive.html</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">Now, our program can create a ciculation transaction report with multiple charts. Currently,
						our SQL query find four types transactions (i, o, f, r) in the last 10 days. What about if you want to find 
						only checkout and checkin in the last 5 days? Of course, you can change the sql query accordingly. However, 
						it is not a good idea to modify a sql query inside the program every time when we need a different serach.
						<br><br>
						We have a better way. Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL database adapter) can pass variables to SQL queries. 
						We will get a user input as variables using Python sys.argv. And we will pass them to a sql query 
						using psycopg adapter. In this way, we can create an interactive program. 
						<br><br>
						I am going to demonstrate how it runs. I have three user inputs	(days, transaction types, output filename).
						<br><br>
						(In teminal, run it interactively).
						<br><br>
						I will not go deeper on this subject. But this technique will be used in the next section, Jupyter.
