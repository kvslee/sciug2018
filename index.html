				        Welcome everyone. Hi, my name is SeongHeon. I am a systems & technology librarian at Chapman University Law Library. 
						First of all, thank you all for joining this session. 
						<br><br>Today, I will share about Sirera SQL API and Plotly. 
				    </aside>

					<aside class="notes">
						When SCIUG requsted presentation proposals with a list of interests. 
						(CLICK)
						I find that there are some interests in SQL report-writing, Sierra APIs, and Stats and other ways of reporting.
						I think that I can cover those interests in one presentation.  
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Final Product Preview</h3>
					<a href="circulation_report.html" target="_blank" >Circulation Transaction Report</a>
					<aside class="notes">
						Why don't we start with looking at an outcome that you are expected to build after this presentation.
						This will give us an idea to understand our goal of the presentation. 
						<br><br>
						I will show a circulation transaction report using Sierra SQL API and Plotly. The basic process is 
						to extract data from Sierra's PostgreSql database and to create a report using Plotly visualization tool. 
						<br><br>
						Let's take a look at a sample outcome.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (1)</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Sierra has Web Management Reports</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>How many of you are using WMR?</li>
						<li>What is your user exprience?</li>
						<li>Decision Center</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						My first question is this. Why do we need a custom report program? (CLICK) As you know, Sierra provides 
						with a build-in report prgoram, called Web Management Reports (WMR). How many of you are using WMR? 
						What is your user exprience? Personally, I do not have many words to say about it, 
						because I have not used it much. Preparing this presentation, I revisited the report program to make 
						a quick evaluation. My first impression is that it has not been improved for a long time. 
						UI is old and not intuitive. 
						<br><br>
						I know that Innovative has a new data analytic product, Decision Center. Again, I have no word to say about Decision Center, 
						because I have no exprience of the product. But I am not sure how many libraries are affordable to purchase 
						the product, particularly a library running a small or medium size of colletion.
						Would it be valuable enough for the money we invest? The answer may be "yes" for some libraries, or 'not' for others.
						<br><br>
						I think that Sierra APIs (SQL Direct, REST) are great tools to leverage the gap. A custom report program, which
						is built with the APIs, can provide a good solution for data analytics.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (2)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Who uses what?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Compare resource usages by libraries</li>
						<li>Compare by the following criteria:
							<ul>
								<li>locations</li>
								<li>patron types</li>
								<li>item types</li>
								<li>transaction times</li>
								<li>etc...</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Particularly, for the shown example, I started with questioning who uses what? (CLICK)
						Chapman	University have three branches in Sierra, Leatherby, Law Library, Brandman.
						Haven't you ever been curious about how different libraries use library resources?  
						Our library director was curious about how Leatherby (the main library) and Law Library utilize resources. 
						Because the size of collections and users, Leatherby should use more resources than Law Library does. 
						That is a reasonable assumption. Can we prove that assumption with factual data. 
						<br><br>
						This is one example of how data analytics can be useful. Going further, we can compare 
						library resource usage not only by libraries but also 
						by locations, patron types,	item types, transaction times, etc.
					</aside>
					<br>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why (3)?</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Why not?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Plenty of data visualization tools (Open Source)</li>
						<li>Open Library Stacks (Direct SQL & REST API)</li>
						<li>Customize a data report as you wish</li>
					</ul>				
					<aside class="notes">One of the best way to answer a question "Why?" is to ask "Why Not?" (CLICK)
						There are many data visualization tools available. Many of them are open sources.
						We are evolving into a data-driven society. We hear so many buzz words like big data, 
						AI, machine learning, data analytics, data visualization, etc. 
						With such a high demand and interest of data, there will be more tools being developed.
						<br><br>
						Innovative advocates Open Library Stacks (OLS) architecture. With the merger of Polaris 
						and VTLS, OLS idea becomes more important. The main idea is to creat a highly scalable cloud platform
						to make their different products communicating each other. For this goal, APIs are critically important,
						because APIs make different products share and exchange data. Successful vendors implement APIs 
						to create the ecosystem that their products lead in competative market. 
						They outreach more developers and users.
						<br><br>
						We are creative beings. We like to customize reports as we wish. Data matters. But 
						data presentaiton also matters. We all have expriences in tweaking an excel file to create 
						a nice report. We can do the same with using APIs and visualization tools.

						<li><a href="http://techdocs.iii.com/sierradna/" target="_blank">SierraDNA</a></li>
						<li>Learn the structure of Sierra database</li>
						<li>Find a table in category and search</li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						I just explained how to connect to Sierra Database. Now we need to learn database structure.
						<br><br>
						PGAdmin displays all 349 viewable tables (under sierra_view schema). To get familiar,
						you need to spend some times. You may browse through all tables in PGAdmin. 
						However, often times, some tables or fields are not obvious to understand.
						<br><br>Then, you can go to 
						SierraDNA, which is the msot valuable resource to learn Sierra database. 
						[Show SierraDNA]
						<br><br>
						It includes detailed descriptions on tables and fields. 
						To find a table, you can follow category or use the search box on the top right. 
						SierraDNA shows not only detailed table view but also Entity Relationship
						Diagram. ERD is useful to create a join querr because it visualizes relationships among tables.

					<h3>Find Checkouts </h3><h5>(PGAdmin Demo)</h5>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
					-- Search for checkedout
					SELECT pv.home_library_code, pv.ptype_code, c.checkout_gmt, c.renewal_count, pv.barcode, c.item_record_id 
					FROM sierra_view.checkout AS c
					JOIN sierra_view.patron_view AS pv ON pv.id = c.patron_record_id
					WHERE NOW() - c.checkout_gmt <= interval '3 hours'
					AND pv.home_library_code = 'lhome'
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">Now let me show you a real query in PGADMIN. 
						<br><br>
						First, open PGADMIN. Once we are connected to Sierra database, 
						you will see all tables and fields. 
						<br><br>To make a query, we click SQL button. We see query pane and result pane. 
						Let's copy and paste the left SQL query and run it. 
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly & Sierra</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Transactions by Patron Home Library</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reuse an offline script</li>
						<li>Use Sierra data, not a dummy one</li>
						<li>New things:
							<ul>
								<li>Connection & query: psycopg2</li>
								<li>Transform Sierra data to plotly data</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">So far, we have learned how to create a chart with Plotly and how to query Sierra data.
						Now is a time to put them together. We will create Plotly charts that visualize transactions 
						by Patron Home Library for the last 10 days. [CLICK]
						<br><br>
						We will reuse the same offline script that was used before in Plotly demo, 
						because visualization logic is the same. However, in this time, we will use actual Sierra 
						data, instead of dummy data. 
						<br><br>
						There are some new processes involved. To get data, we need to connect and run a query on Sierra database. 
						I showed a demo how to do this in PGAdmin. Now, how do we do that in a Python program?
						We will use a PostgreSQL database adapter, called psycopg2. With psycopg2,
						we can connect Sierra database and run a query in Python program.  
						<br><br>
						Afte we receive data from Sirera, we need to manipuate the data into a right format that Plotly requires. 
						<br><br>

					<h3>Sierra SQL Output</h3>
					<img src="images/sql_output.png">
					<aside class="notes"> You may feel a little puzzled on the data transformation part. 
						Why do we need to transform Sierra data before using it for Plotly? <br>
						That is because Plotly needs X and Y axes data in specific structure.  
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Plotly X Y Axes</h3>
					<img src="images/transform_data.png">
					<aside class="notes">I have chart_data function that takes care of this business. 
						The function reads through each row of the patron_home_library_code column 
						and count record by patron_home_library. 
						<br><br>Finally, we see that data is arranged for Plotly x and y axes. 
						It is in two-demensional list format.
					</aside>					
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Embed Sierra Charts</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we embed multiple charts in one HTML page?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use the same SQL output from circ_trans</li>
						<li>Run data transformations on each column</li>
						<li>Pltoly option: output_type='div'</li>
						<li>Pass chart outputs to the template engine</li>
						<li>Multiple charts will be embedded as instructed in a template file</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Can we present multiple charts in one html document? [CLICK] Yes, we can. 
						We can store charts in div and pass the charts into a template using Jinja2 template engine. 
						<br><br>
						For this time, we will use the same Sierra data that we used in the previous example. 
						Because we create multiple charts, we will transform data
						for each column (patron_home_library, ptype_code, time, op_code, itype_code, item_location). 
						<br><br>
						We will feed the transformed data of each column to Plotly. 
						Then, plotly output charts into divs.
						The chart outputs will be passed to the template engine and then
						the multuple charts will be displayed in HTML as instructed in a template file.

					<h3>Interactive Program</h3>
					<p><span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="1">Can we specify days and transaction types?</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Python <span style="color:#ff9999">sys.argv</span> - read user inputs from terminal</li>
						<li>User Inputs:
							<ul>
								<li>days</li>
								<li>transaction types(o i f r) </li>
								<li>ouput filename</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>python sierra_chart_embed.py 60 oi sierra_interactive.html</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">Our program created a transaction report with multiple charts. The SQL query retrieved
						data of four types transactions (i, o, f, r) and in the last 10 days. What about if you want to find 
						only checkout (o) and checkin (i) and in the last 5 days? [CLICK] Of course, you can change the sql query accordingly. 
						However, it is not a good idea to modify a sql query inside the program whenever we need a different serach.
						<br><br>
						We have a better way. Psycopg2 (PostgreSQL database adapter) can dynamically pass user inputs to a SQL query. 
						We will get user inputs using Python sys.argv in terminal. And we will pass them to a sql query 
						using psycopg2. In this way, we can create an interactive program. 
						<br><br>
						I am going to demonstrate how it runs. I have three user inputs	(days, transaction types, output filename).
						<br><br>
						(In teminal, run it interactively).
